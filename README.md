# üß† BERTify: The Complete Guide to Encoder Transformer Research

> **"Stop using transformers as black boxes. Start building them."**

A comprehensive, hands-on educational journey that takes you from transformer novice to research-ready practitioner. Learn the **right way** to work with encoder transformers like BERT - not just how to use them, but how to truly understand and build them.

## üéØ Why This Guide Exists

Most tutorials teach you to use Hugging Face models without understanding what's underneath. That's fine for production, but **terrible for research**. This guide bridges that gap by:

- **Starting with the math** - implementing attention mechanisms from scratch
- **Showing the tools** - mastering Hugging Face the right way  
- **Building from scratch** - creating your own BERT implementation
- **Teaching evaluation** - proper benchmarking and research methodology

## üöÄ Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (`pytorch_basics/`)
*Master the fundamentals before scaling up*

- **Simple Neural Networks**: Build basic models with proper PyTorch patterns
- **Model Persistence**: Save/load models with reproducible results
- **Research Patterns**: Code organization that scales to complex experiments

### Phase 2: Transformer Mathematics (`transformer_basics/`)
*Understand the core mechanism that powers everything*

- **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: The mathematical heart of transformers
- **Query, Key, Value**: From concept to implementation
- **Attention Visualization**: See what the model actually learns

### Phase 3: Mastering Pre-trained Models (`prefab/`)
*Learn to use existing models effectively*

- **ü§ó Hugging Face Mastery**: From basic inference to advanced usage
- **Local Model Management**: Download, save, and deploy models properly
- **Dataset Integration**: Work with real-world datasets (WikiText-2, etc.)
- **Evaluation Pipelines**: Measure model performance correctly

### Phase 4: Building from Scratch (`networks/`)
*Create your own transformer architecture*

- **Custom BERT Implementation**: Every layer, every parameter
- **Architecture Exploration**: Experiment with different configurations  
- **Comparative Analysis**: Your model vs. the originals

### Phase 5: Research Reference (`papers_ref/`)
*Academic foundations and cutting-edge research*

- **Original Papers**: BERT and foundational transformer research
- **Implementation Notes**: Bridging theory and practice
